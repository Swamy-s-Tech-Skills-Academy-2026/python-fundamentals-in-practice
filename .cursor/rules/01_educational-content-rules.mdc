# Educational Content Rules (Python Fundamentals)

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: December 2025  
**Priority**: MANDATORY - All content creation must follow these rules without exception

---

## 🚫 Zero-Copy Policy (Non-Negotiable)

**CRITICAL**: All educational content must be transformative, not reformative.

❌ **NEVER** copy text verbatim from books, articles, websites, videos, or third-party materials  
❌ **NEVER** mirror a source's outline, section order, headings, or example sequence  
❌ **NEVER** use "light paraphrasing" — must transform completely  
✅ **ALWAYS** create diagrams in Mermaid-first style with ASCII fallback (never embed copyrighted figures)  
✅ **ALWAYS** write fresh, minimal code from first principles  
✅ Brief quotations allowed ONLY with quotation marks and source citation

---

## 🔄 Transformative Workflow (Required Every Time)

**Step-by-step process for creating original educational content**:

1. **Source Intake**: Skim for intent and big ideas; don't copy notes verbatim
2. **Concept Map**: Create fresh outline with different sectioning tailored to Python Fundamentals curriculum
3. **Teach Differently**: Use new analogies, scenarios, datasets, use-cases (avoid source examples)
4. **Produce Original Artifacts**: Explanations, Mermaid diagrams (with ASCII fallback), minimal examples
5. **Cross-Link in Python Fundamentals**: Add prerequisites/builds-upon/enables across levels and sessions
6. **Similarity Audit**: Ensure no sentences/structures resemble source
7. **Optional References**: Add "References/Inspired by" links (no copied phrasing)

**Goal**: Create transformative educational content, not just reformative. Entirely new presentation, examples, and explanations that teach the same concepts through original methods.

## ⏱️ 30-Minute Learning Segments

✅ **Modular content** designed for focused 30-minute sessions  
✅ **Multi-Part Structure**: Complex topics split into Part 1, Part 2, ... Part N  
✅ **One-Shot Learning**: Each segment complete and actionable within time limit  
✅ **Target Length**: 150 lines of content maximum per response (flexible for educational clarity)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Splitting vs. Trimming Policy

**MANDATORY APPROACH**: When content exceeds 150 lines, **ALWAYS SPLIT** into multiple parts. **NEVER TRIM** or condense content.

**Why Splitting is Required:**
- ✅ **Preserves ALL educational content** - No loss of examples, explanations, or concepts
- ✅ **Maintains learning value** - Each part remains complete and actionable
- ✅ **Better learning experience** - Learners get comprehensive coverage across parts
- ✅ **Follows 25-minute principle** - Each part fits within focused learning session

**Why Trimming is Prohibited:**
- ❌ **Loses educational content** - Examples, explanations, or concepts may be removed
- ❌ **Reduces learning value** - Condensed content may miss important details
- ❌ **Violates zero-copy policy** - If source had comprehensive content, we should preserve it
- ❌ **Poor learning experience** - Learners miss important information

**Splitting Process:**
1. **Identify logical breakpoints** - Split at natural topic boundaries (e.g., "Foundation" → "Implementation" → "Advanced")
2. **Preserve all content** - Move content to appropriate part, don't delete
3. **Maintain completeness** - Each part should be self-contained and complete
4. **Use proper naming** - Follow naming convention: `Part1-A.md`, `Part1-B.md`, etc.
5. **Update references** - Update all file references after splitting

**Example**: If a file has 300 lines covering "Factory Pattern Fundamentals" and "Factory Pattern Advanced", split into:
- `01_Factory-Pattern-Part1-A.md` (Fundamentals - 150 lines)
- `01_Factory-Pattern-Part1-B.md` (Advanced - 150 lines)

**NOT**: Condense to 150 lines by removing examples or explanations.

## 📋 Required Content Structure

### Session Documentation Structure

Every session documentation file MUST include:

**Session Documentation Structure** (docs/sessions/L{level}/S{session}.md):
1. **Session Overview** - Duration (30 minutes), type, level
2. **Learning Objectives** - What students will learn
3. **Prerequisites** - What's needed before starting
4. **Content Sections** - Progressive learning steps
5. **Practice Files** - References to source code (src/L{level}/S{session}/)
6. **Key Takeaways** - Summary of concepts
7. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

**Note**: YAML frontmatter is optional for session documentation. Focus on clear structure and educational flow.

### File Naming Convention

**Python Practice Files** (src/L{level}/S{session}/):
- ✅ Use descriptive names with numeric prefixes: `01_hello.py`, `02_interactive_hello.py`
- ✅ Format: `{number}_{descriptive_name}.py`
- ✅ Example: `01_hello.py`, `02_interactive_hello.py`, `bytecode_demo.py`

**Session Documentation** (docs/sessions/L{level}/):
- ✅ Use level and session identifiers: `S1.md`, `S2.md`, `Plan.md`
- ✅ Format: `S{session}.md` or `Plan.md`
- ✅ Example: `L1/S1.md`, `L1/S2.md`, `L1/Plan.md`

**Directory Structure**:
- ✅ Levels: Always use `L{number}` format (L1, L2, L3, etc.)
- ✅ Sessions: Always use `S{number}` format (S1, S2, S3, etc.)
- ✅ Path references: Use `src/L1/S1/` not `src/S1/`
- ✅ Documentation paths: Use `docs/sessions/L1/S1.md` not `docs/sessions/S1.md`

**Why This Rule Exists**:
- Maintains consistent numbering across the repository
- Prevents confusion about file ordering
- Ensures predictable file organization
- `01_` clearly indicates the first item, `00_` is ambiguous

### Learning Order Requirements (CRITICAL)

**CRITICAL**: Session numbering MUST reflect logical learning dependencies, not arbitrary ordering.

**Standard Python Fundamentals Learning Progression** (Level 1: Noob → Nerd):

1. **S1**: Python Introduction & Environment Setup - Foundation
2. **S2**: Variables & Data Types - Core building blocks
3. **S3**: Operators & Expressions - Calculations and logic
4. **S4**: Conditionals, Indentation & Modules - Control flow
5. **MP1**: Mini Project 1: Simple Calculator - Apply Sessions 1-4
6. **S5**: Loops & Iteration - Repetition and iteration
7. **S6**: Basic Debugging & Built-in Functions - Error handling
8. **S7**: Lists & Loops - Data structures
9. **S8**: Dictionaries & Basic Testing - Advanced data structures
10. **MP2**: Mini Project 2: Personal Profile Generator - Apply Sessions 5-8

**Why This Order Matters**:

- Variables (S2) must come BEFORE Operators (S3) - need to understand data storage first
- Conditionals (S4) must come BEFORE Loops (S5) - loops use conditional logic
- Lists (S7) must come BEFORE Dictionaries (S8) - dictionaries build on list concepts
- Mini Projects consolidate learning from previous sessions

**When Creating New Content**:

- ✅ Verify prerequisites are in sessions BEFORE the new content
- ✅ Check that "enables" relationships point to sessions numbered AFTER
- ✅ Ensure learning dependencies match session numbering order
- ❌ NEVER place content that depends on later-numbered sessions

### File Naming Convention for Split Files

**CRITICAL**: When files are split into multiple parts, use simplified letter suffixes.

**Pattern**:

- `Topic-Part1-Part1.md` → `Topic-Part1-A.md`
- `Topic-Part1-Part2.md` → `Topic-Part1-B.md`
- `Topic-Part2-Part1.md` → `Topic-Part2-A.md`
- `Topic-Part2-Part2.md` → `Topic-Part2-B.md`
- `Topic-Part1-Part2-Part1.md` → `Topic-Part1-B-A.md`
- `Topic-Part1-Part2-Part2.md` → `Topic-Part1-B-B.md`

**Rules**:
1. ✅ **Keep first Part number** - First `Part1`, `Part2`, etc. stays as-is
2. ✅ **Convert subsequent Part numbers to letters** - `Part1` → `A`, `Part2` → `B`, etc.
3. ✅ **Use uppercase letters** - A, B, C, D, etc. (not a, b, c)
4. ✅ **Maintain order** - Letters reflect the original Part number sequence

**Examples**:
- ✅ `01_OOP-Introduction-Part1-A.md` (was `Part1-Part1`)
- ✅ `01_OOP-Introduction-Part1-B.md` (was `Part1-Part2`)
- ✅ `02_Classes-and-Objects-Part2-A.md` (was `Part2-Part1`)
- ✅ `03_Encapsulation-Part1-B-A.md` (was `Part1-Part2-Part1`)

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner, more readable file names
- Easier to understand part relationships
- Consistent naming pattern

## 🎓 Educational Excellence Standards

All content must demonstrate:

- ✅ **Clear objectives and outcomes**: Specific, measurable learning goals
- ✅ **Progressive scaffolding**: Foundations → Practice → Pitfalls → Next Steps
- ✅ **Original examples, datasets, and exercises**: Never reuse source examples
- ✅ **Mermaid-first visuals**: Primary Mermaid diagrams with ASCII fallback for compatibility
- ✅ **Cross-references across tracks**: Development, AI/ML, Data Science, DevOps

---

## ✅ Quality Gate Questions (Before Publishing)

**Self-check before finalizing any educational content**:

1. ✅ Is this explanation clearer than the source material?
2. ✅ Does this fit naturally in the learning progression?
3. ✅ Would a learner understand this without the original source?
4. ✅ Are the examples relevant and practical?
5. ✅ Does this content add educational value beyond the reference?
6. ✅ Is this content within 150 lines for effective delivery?

---

## 📁 Content Placement Policy

✅ `Reference/` is EXCLUSIVELY for learning content  
❌ Never mix planning materials, workflow docs, or meta content  
✅ Group logically by learning progression, not source structure  
✅ Place content in correct domain folder (Development/AI-ML/Data-Science/DevOps)

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Code Examples Policy

**This repository includes both educational content AND practice code files.**

**Code Examples in Educational Content:**

- ✅ **Working Examples**: All code examples must run without errors
- ✅ **Beginner-Friendly**: Code should be understandable by complete beginners
- ✅ **Educational Comments**: Include clear comments explaining concepts
- ✅ **Practice Files**: Store working code in `src/L{level}/S{session}/` directories
- ✅ **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build complexity gradually

**When Creating Code Examples:**

1. **Keep it working**: All code must run without syntax errors
2. **Add educational comments**: Explain what the code demonstrates
3. **File headers**: Include filename and session reference in comments
4. **Focus on learning**: Code should teach concepts clearly

**Example Structure:**

```python
# Filename: src/L1/S1/01_hello.py
# Session 1: Python Introduction & Environment Setup

print('Hello, World!')
# This is a single-line comment
```

**Practice Files Location:**
- Store all practice code in `src/L{level}/S{session}/` directories
- Reference practice files in session documentation
- Example: `src/L1/S1/01_hello.py`, `src/L1/S1/02_interactive_hello.py`

### Content Organization

**Session Documentation** (docs/sessions/L{level}/):
- Store all session documentation in `docs/sessions/L{level}/` directories
- Format: `S1.md`, `S2.md`, `Plan.md`
- Each session should reference practice files in `src/L{level}/S{session}/`

**Practice Code** (src/L{level}/S{session}/):
- Store all practice Python files in `src/L{level}/S{session}/` directories
- Format: `01_descriptive_name.py`, `02_descriptive_name.py`
- All code must be working and tested

**Images** (docs/images/):
- Store educational images in `docs/images/S{session}/` directories
- Reference images in session documentation using relative paths

**Content Workflow**:

1. **Create Session Documentation**: Write session content in `docs/sessions/L{level}/S{session}.md`
2. **Create Practice Files**: Write working Python code in `src/L{level}/S{session}/`
3. **Link Together**: Reference practice files in session documentation
4. **Test Everything**: Ensure all code runs and all links work
5. **Quality Check**: Run markdownlint and link validation before committing

**Transformation Workflow** (Using CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning):

**🚨 CRITICAL**: This workflow uses **THE EXACT SAME 7-CATEGORY REVIEW CHECKLIST** as the Comprehensive Content Review Process. Every file created during migration MUST pass all review checks before being considered complete.

1. **OBSERVE**: Place source materials (transcripts, notes, etc.) in `source-materials/` (at repository root)
   - Scan and catalog source content
   - Identify key concepts and learning objectives
   - Understand source structure and dependencies

2. **ANALYZE**: Apply review rules DURING transformation using CoT/ReAct methodology:
   - **Reason through transformation**: Break down source content into logical learning segments
   - **Apply 7-category review checklist while transforming**:
     - Verify YAML frontmatter structure as you create it
     - Ensure content is transformative (not copied) during transformation
     - **Check line count as you build content (≤ 150 lines) - SPLIT if exceeds, NEVER TRIM**
     - Validate file naming conventions during creation
     - Verify file references as you add them
     - Ensure zero-copy policy compliance during transformation
     - Confirm learning progression logic as you structure content
     - **Preserve ALL educational content through splitting, not condensing**
   - **Use Chain-of-Thought**: Think through each transformation step explicitly
   - **Apply Reasoning**: Make logical decisions about content structure, examples, and explanations

3. **REASON**: Create new educational content in appropriate `01_Reference/`, `02_Learning/`, or `03_Interview-Prep/` folders
   - Apply logical reasoning to determine correct placement
   - Ensure learning dependencies are properly structured
   - Verify content flow and progression

4. **VERIFY**: Review final content using comprehensive review checklist before committing
   - Cross-check all requirements
   - Validate compliance with all rules
   - Confirm zero-copy policy adherence
   - **Create migration verification report** in `docs/review-reports/` with date-based naming (e.g., `24Nov2025.md`)

5. **ACT**: After successful migration and verification:
   - Keep source files in `source-materials/` folder - user will delete manually
   - Save migration verification report to `docs/review-reports/` with date-based filename

**Compliance Requirements**:
- ❌ `source-materials/` files: **NO compliance required** (staging area - raw source content)
- ✅ **Transformation process**: **MUST follow review rules** (apply checklist during transformation)
- ✅ `01_Reference/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `02_Learning/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)
- ✅ `03_Interview-Prep/` files: **FULL compliance required** (final content - must pass all review checks)

**Review During Migration** (Using CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning):

- **OBSERVE**: Systematically analyze source content before transformation
- **ANALYZE**: Apply the 7-category Individual File Review Checklist **while transforming** content
  - Use Chain-of-Thought to break down transformation into logical steps
  - Apply ReAct methodology: Observe → Analyze → Reason → Verify → Act
  - Use systematic reasoning to make transformation decisions
- **REASON**: Make logical decisions about:
  - Content structure and organization
  - Example selection and creation
  - Learning progression and dependencies
  - File naming and references
- **VERIFY**: Don't wait until after migration - catch issues during the transformation process
  - Verify compliance at each step: YAML structure, line count, naming, references, zero-copy policy
  - Cross-check findings as you transform
- **ACT**: Final review after migration confirms all requirements are met

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE ALIGNMENT**: Migration and Review use **THE EXACT SAME RULES AND CHECKLIST**. The 7-category Individual File Review Checklist (YAML Frontmatter, Content Structure, File Naming, File References, Content Quality, Zero-Copy Policy, Learning Progression) MUST be applied during migration/transformation, not just during review. The same CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning methodology used for reviews MUST be applied during migration/transformation.

### Level and Session Creation Policy

**Important**: Level and session directories are created **as needed** when content is ready.

**Policy**:
- ✅ Create `L{level}/S{session}/` directories when you have content ready to add
- ✅ Follow the 9-level progression structure (L1 through L9)
- ✅ Each level contains 10 sessions (S1 through S10) plus 2 mini projects
- ✅ Add content progressively following Educational Content Rules
- ✅ Create folder structure incrementally as curriculum develops

**Rationale**: This prevents creating empty structures that may never be populated, while allowing for planned curriculum to be established when content is ready.

## 🔗 File Reference Requirements (CRITICAL)

### Mandatory Practices

**CRITICAL**: All file references MUST point to existing files or be clearly marked as planned content.

### When Creating File References

1. ✅ **Verify file exists** before adding reference
2. ✅ **Use exact file names** - match actual file names exactly
3. ✅ **Use correct paths** - `src/L1/S1/01_hello.py`, `docs/sessions/L1/S1.md`
4. ✅ **Test references** - verify all links work in markdown preview
5. ✅ **Update after changes** - when renaming files, update ALL references immediately

### When Renaming or Moving Files

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**:

1. Identify all files that reference the file being renamed/moved
2. Update ALL references to use new file name/path
3. Test all links in markdown preview
4. Verify all code imports still work (if applicable)
5. Run markdownlint to ensure formatting is correct

### Reference Patterns

- **Practice Files**: Reference as `src/L1/S1/01_hello.py` in session documentation
- **Session Documentation**: Reference as `docs/sessions/L1/S1.md` or `[Session 1](docs/sessions/L1/S1.md)`
- **Images**: Reference as `../../images/S1/Help_V1.PNG` from session documentation
- **Planned Content**: References to files that don't exist yet are acceptable IF clearly marked as planned

### Validation Checklist

Before committing:
- [ ] All references point to existing files (or are clearly planned)
- [ ] Navigation links work in markdown preview
- [ ] All Python code files run without errors
- [ ] All image references resolve correctly
- [ ] Run markdownlint: `npx --yes markdownlint-cli2 "docs/**/*.md"`
- [ ] Run link checker: Use lychee with `lychee.toml` configuration

## 🎯 Mini Project Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: All mini projects must be **practical and achievable** for students at their current level.

### Mini Project Policy

✅ **ALWAYS** build on concepts from previous sessions  
✅ **ALWAYS** include clear requirements and success criteria  
✅ **ALWAYS** provide practice files and examples  
✅ **ALWAYS** include stretch goals for advanced students  
❌ **NEVER** require concepts not yet covered in the curriculum  
❌ **NEVER** make projects too complex for the current level  

**Rationale**: Mini projects consolidate learning and build confidence. They should be achievable but challenging.

**Examples of Mini Projects**:
- **Level 1, MP1**: Simple Calculator (uses Sessions 1-4: variables, operators, conditionals)
- **Level 1, MP2**: Personal Profile Generator (uses Sessions 5-8: loops, lists, dictionaries)

**When Creating Mini Projects**:
1. Review prerequisite sessions to ensure all needed concepts are covered
2. Provide clear requirements and success criteria
3. Include example solutions or guidance
4. Add stretch goals for students who finish early
5. Test all code examples thoroughly

---

## 🔍 Comprehensive Content Review Process

**MANDATORY**: All content in `01_Reference/`, `02_Learning/`, and `03_Interview-Prep/` folders must undergo comprehensive review using CoT (Chain-of-Thought), ReAct (Reasoning + Acting), and systematic reasoning.

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE ALIGNMENT**: Migration and Review use **THE EXACT SAME RULES AND CHECKLIST**. The 7-category Individual File Review Checklist MUST be applied during migration/transformation, not just during review. This ensures all content is compliant from the moment it's created.

### Review Request Protocol

**When a review is REQUESTED**:

- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Review EACH AND EVERY file individually - no file should be skipped
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Open and examine every file in the specified scope
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Apply the 7-category review checklist to every single file
- ❌ **NEVER**: Skip files, assume compliance, or review only a sample
- ❌ **NEVER**: Review only files that "look problematic" - review ALL files

**Scope of Review**:
- If reviewing `01_Reference/` folder: Review ALL files in `01_Reference/`
- If reviewing `02_Learning/` folder: Review ALL files in `02_Learning/`
- If reviewing `03_Interview-Prep/` folder: Review ALL files in `03_Interview-Prep/`
- If reviewing a specific subfolder: Review ALL files in that subfolder
- If reviewing specific files: Review each requested file individually

### Review Methodology

**Use CoT, ReAct, and Reasoning for every review**:

1. **OBSERVE**: Systematically scan and catalog all files
   - List every file in the review scope
   - No file should be excluded or skipped
2. **ANALYZE**: Review each file individually with deep analysis
   - Open and examine every file
   - Apply review checklist to each file
3. **REASON**: Apply logical reasoning to identify issues and patterns
4. **VERIFY**: Cross-check findings and validate compliance
5. **ACT**: Document findings and update content as needed

### Individual File Review Checklist

**Review EACH AND EVERY file individually** - no file should be skipped:

#### 1. YAML Frontmatter Review

#### 7. Learning Progression Review
- [ ] File numbering reflects logical learning dependencies
- [ ] Prerequisites come before dependent content
- [ ] `enables:` relationships point to content numbered after
- [ ] Learning order is logical and sequential

### Deep Dive Review Process

**When performing comprehensive review**:

1. **Systematic File Scanning**
   ```powershell
   # Get all files to review
   Get-ChildItem "src\01_Reference" -Recurse -Filter "*.md" | 
       Where-Object { $_.Name -ne "README.md" }
   ```

2. **Individual File Analysis**
   - Open each file
   - Check YAML frontmatter structure
   - Verify all metadata fields
   - Count lines (must be ≤ 150)
   - Check file naming conventions
   - Validate all file references
   - Review content quality indicators

3. **Reference Validation**
   ```powershell
   # Run reference validation
   .\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1
   ```

4. **Content Quality Analysis**
   - Check for code examples
   - Check for diagrams (Mermaid/ASCII)
   - Check for headings
   - Check for suspicious patterns
   - Verify zero-copy compliance

5. **Documentation**
   - Document all findings
   - Create issue list with file paths
   - Prioritize issues (critical vs. warnings)
   - Track fixes and verification

### Review Tools

**Use these tools for comprehensive review**:

- `.\tools\psscripts\Comprehensive-ReferenceReview.ps1` - Deep dive review with CoT/ReAct methodology
- `.\tools\psscripts\Validate-FileReferences.ps1` - File reference validation
- `.\tools\psscripts\Review-EducationalContent.ps1` - General compliance review

### Review Frequency

- **Before committing**: Review all modified files
- **After splitting files**: Review all affected files and references
- **Periodic audits**: Comprehensive review of entire `01_Reference/` folder
- **After major changes**: Full review of affected sections

### Review Documentation

**Always document review findings**:

- Create review reports with findings
- List all issues found (with file paths)
- Track compliance statistics
- Document fixes applied
- Verify fixes after remediation
