# 🤖 Copilot Instructions for Python Fundamentals Project

**Project:** Python Fundamentals Curriculum  
**Owner:** Swamy's Tech Skills Academy  
**Purpose:** Educational content development and maintenance

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST**

### **1. 🛡️ DO NOT CORRUPT EXISTING FILES**

- **NEVER** make changes that break existing content
- **ALWAYS** preserve the original structure and formatting
- **VERIFY** changes are minimal and necessary before applying
- **TEST** understanding by reading the full context before editing
- **ASK FOR CONFIRMATION** if changes seem extensive or risky

### **2. 📖 UNDERSTAND BEFORE ACTING**

- **READ** the entire file or section before making any edits
- **ANALYZE** the existing structure and content quality
- **RESPECT** the pedagogical flow and curriculum design
- **PRESERVE** all educational content, examples, and explanations

### **3. 🎯 MAKE PRECISE, TARGETED CHANGES**

- **IDENTIFY** the exact issue to be fixed
- **ISOLATE** the specific text that needs modification
- **MINIMIZE** the scope of changes
- **MAINTAIN** surrounding context and formatting

### **4. 🚫 ZERO-COPY POLICY (Non-Negotiable)**

- **NEVER** copy text verbatim from books, articles, websites, videos, or third-party materials
- **NEVER** mirror a source's outline, section order, headings, or example sequence
- **NEVER** use "light paraphrasing" — must transform completely
- **ALWAYS** create diagrams in Mermaid-first style with ASCII fallback (never embed copyrighted figures)
- **ALWAYS** write fresh, minimal code from first principles
- Brief quotations allowed ONLY with quotation marks and source citation
- **Goal**: Create transformative educational content, not just reformative

**See `.cursor/rules/01_educational-content-rules.mdc` for complete Zero-Copy Policy and Transformative Workflow details.**

---

## 🎓 **CURRICULUM PHILOSOPHY**

### **Educational Approach:**

- **30-minute sessions** - Realistic time constraints
- **Splitting over trimming** - If content is too long, split into multiple parts instead of removing educational material
- **Progressive complexity** - Each session builds on previous
- **Hands-on practice** - Every concept has practical application
- **Visual learning** - Emojis, diagrams, and clear formatting
- **Beginner-focused** - No assumptions about prior knowledge

**See `.cursor/rules/01_educational-content-rules.mdc` for details on the splitting policy.**

### **Content Quality Standards:**

- **Pedagogically sound** - Based on learning theory
- **Technically accurate** - All code examples work correctly
- **Professionally presented** - Industry-standard documentation
- **Accessible** - Clear language and multiple learning styles

## 🧠 **CoT/ReAct METHODOLOGY**

### **For Content CREATION (THINK → REASON → ACT → VERIFY):**

| Phase      | Steps                                                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **THINK**  | Understand objective → Decompose into chunks → Sequence logically → Anticipate misconceptions |
| **REASON** | Check prerequisites → Map connections → Design examples → Identify pitfalls                   |
| **ACT**    | Write content → Create code examples → Add diagrams → Design exercises                        |
| **VERIFY** | Is it clear? → Complete? → Progressive? → Original?                                           |

### **For Content REVIEW (OBSERVE → ANALYZE → REASON → VERIFY → ACT):**

| Phase       | Steps                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **OBSERVE** | Scan and catalog ALL files in scope           |
| **ANALYZE** | Open and examine EVERY file individually      |
| **REASON**  | Apply logical reasoning to identify issues    |
| **VERIFY**  | Cross-check findings and validate compliance  |
| **ACT**     | Document findings and update content          |

### **Decision Framework:**

```text
CREATION: THINK → REASON → ACT → VERIFY → (iterate if needed)
REVIEW:   OBSERVE → ANALYZE → REASON → VERIFY → ACT
```

### **Reasoning in Educational Content:**

**CRITICAL**: All code examples and explanations must show the "Why" behind decisions, not just the "What".

**✅ DO**: Include explicit reasoning for code design decisions

- Show why a data structure was chosen
- Explain alternative approaches and trade-offs
- Make the thought process visible to learners

**❌ AVOID**: Stating facts without reasoning

- Don't just say "use a dictionary" - explain WHY
- Don't skip the reasoning chain from problem to solution

**See `.cursor/rules/01_educational-content-rules.mdc` for full CoT/ReAct details and reasoning examples.**

## 🔧 **EDITING GUIDELINES**

### **When Making Changes:**

#### **✅ SAFE EDITS:**

- Fixing typos and spelling errors
- Correcting broken links
- Updating file paths that are demonstrably wrong
- Fixing character encoding issues (corrupted emojis)
- Adding missing sections that are clearly incomplete

#### **⚠️ CAREFUL EDITS:**

- Modifying code examples (ensure they still work)
- Changing file structure references
- Updating installation instructions
- Modifying pedagogical explanations

#### **🚫 AVOID:**

- Large-scale content reorganization without explicit request
- Changing the pedagogical approach or learning sequence
- Removing or significantly altering existing explanations
- Modifying time allocations or session structure
- Changing the emoji-based navigation system

### **Before Any Edit:**

1. **Read the full context** - Understand what you're changing
2. **Identify the specific problem** - What exactly needs fixing?
3. **Plan minimal changes** - What's the smallest fix that works?
4. **Preserve surrounding content** - Don't alter unrelated text
5. **Verify the change makes sense** - Does it improve the content?

### **File Path Corrections:**

- Current structure uses `L1/S1/` hierarchy
- Update references from old `S1/` to new `L1/S1/` structure
- Maintain consistency between documentation and code locations

---

## 📝 **COMMON TASKS**

### **Path Updates:**

```markdown
# OLD (incorrect)
src/S1/01_hello.py

# NEW (correct)
src/L1/S1/01_hello.py
```

### **Character Encoding Fixes:**

```markdown
# BROKEN
print("🚀 Advanced Python Preview")

# FIXED  
print("🚀 Advanced Python Preview")
```

### **Link Corrections:**

```markdown
# OLD (incorrect)
[Session 1](docs/sessions/S1.md)
[Session 1](docs/sessions/L1/S1.md)

# NEW (correct)
[Session 1](docs/sessions/L1/01_S1.md)
```

### **File Reference Validation:**

**CRITICAL**: All file references must:

- ✅ Include numeric prefixes (`01_`, `02_`, etc.) in file names
- ✅ Use correct `L{level}/S{session}/` directory structure
- ✅ Match actual file names exactly
- ✅ Be verified before committing

**Common Errors to Avoid:**

- ❌ Missing numeric prefixes: `S1.md` → ✅ `01_S1.md`
- ❌ Missing level identifier: `sessions/S1/` → ✅ `sessions/L1/01_S1.md`
- ❌ Incorrect path structure: `src/S1/` → ✅ `src/L1/S1/`

**See `.cursor/rules/04_markdown-standards.mdc` for detailed file reference validation patterns.**
