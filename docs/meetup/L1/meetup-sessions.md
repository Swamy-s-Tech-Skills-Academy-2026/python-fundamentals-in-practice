## Level 1 - Session 3: Operators & Expressions

Date: 20-Dec-2025

Event URL: (Meetup link will be updated here)  

🔹 Session Agenda:

Level: Noob → Nerd (Level 1, Session 3)  
Format: Live coding session with interactive Q&A  
Duration: 30 minutes
Prerequisites: Completed Previous Sessions

- Optional: Watch the recording/playlist: [Python Fundamentals – Level 1 (YouTube playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6DqbRjsF0&list=PLdLQDTLMjAzpRBxP4q1XJOuLhFG4pSfBB)

Session 3: Operators & Expressions

🎙️ Speaker: Viswanatha Swamy / Swamy's Tech Skills Academy  
🕘 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM (30 minutes)

What You'll Learn:

- Master arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulo, and exponentiation
- Use comparison operators to check equality, inequality, and relationships between values
- Apply assignment operators as shortcuts for updating variables efficiently
- Understand operator precedence and how Python calculates complex expressions
- Control calculation order using parentheses
- Build a working mini calculator that performs multiple operations

Hands-on Practice:
We'll write and run three focused practice scripts:

- `src/L1/S3/01_arithmetic.py` – Explore all seven arithmetic operators with practical examples
- `src/L1/S3/02_comparisons.py` – Compare values and use chained comparisons for range checks
- `src/L1/S3/03_mini_calculator.py` – Build an interactive calculator with all basic operations

Perfect For:

- Learners who've mastered variables and data types from Session 2
- Beginners ready to perform calculations and make comparisons in Python
- Anyone preparing to build their first calculator project in the upcoming mini project

📢 Join us to unlock the power of Python operators and expressions! You'll learn to perform calculations, compare values, and build the foundation for conditionals and decision-making in future sessions.

## Level 1 - Session 2: Variables & Data Types

Date: 17-Dec-2025  

Event URL: (Meetup link will be updated here)  

🔹 Session Agenda:

Level: Noob → Nerd (Level 1, Session 2)  
Format: Live coding session with interactive Q&A  
Prerequisites: Completed Session 1 (Python Introduction & Environment Setup)

- Optional: Watch the recording/playlist: [Python Fundamentals – Level 1 (YouTube playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy6DqbRjsF0&list=PLdLQDTLMjAzpRBxP4q1XJOuLhFG4pSfBB)

Session 2: Variables & Data Types

🎙️ Speaker: Viswanatha Swamy / Swamy's Tech Skills Academy  
🕘 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM (30 minutes)

What You'll Learn:

- Understand what variables are and how to name them clearly
- Explore Python's core data types: integers, floats, strings, and booleans
- See how Python automatically figures out types (dynamic typing)
- Use `type()` and `isinstance()` to inspect data types
- Convert between strings, numbers, and booleans safely
- Build a small “personal profile” program using different data types

Hands-on Practice:
We’ll write and run three focused practice scripts:

- `src/L1/S2/01_variables.py` – Create and update variables with clear names
- `src/L1/S2/02_data_types.py` – Tour of the four fundamental data types
- `src/L1/S2/03_type_conversion.py` – Convert between types and combine values

Perfect For:

- Learners who attended Session 1 and want to keep the momentum going
- Beginners who want to really understand how Python stores and represents data
- Anyone who wants a solid foundation before moving to operators and conditionals

📢 Join us to give your Python programs “memory” with variables and data types, setting up everything you’ll need for calculators, games, and mini projects in later sessions!

## Level 1 - Session 1: Python Introduction & Environment Setup

Date: 14-Dec-2025

Event URL: <https://www.meetup.com/dot-net-learners-house-hyderabad/events/312432302>  

🔹 Session Agenda:

Level: Noob → Nerd (Level 1, Session 1)
Format: Live coding session with interactive Q&A
Prerequisites: None! Just bring your curiosity and a computer.

Session 1: Python Introduction & Environment Setup

🎙️ Speaker: Viswanatha Swamy / Swamy's Tech Skills Academy
🕘 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM (30 minutes)

What You'll Learn:

Set up your Python development environment (Python 3.13+ & VS Code)

Understand what Python is and why it's popular in the industry

Discover how Python works behind the scenes (compilation, bytecode, and the Python Virtual Machine)

Explore the Python Interactive Shell (REPL) for immediate experimentation

Write and run your first Python scripts

Master essential built-in functions: print(), input(), type(), and help()

Learn f-string formatting for dynamic text output

Hands-on Practice:
We'll build three Python scripts together:

01_hello.py - Your first "Hello, World!" program

02_interactive_hello.py - Interactive greeting with user input

bytecode_demo.py - See Python's internal magic in action

Perfect For:

Complete beginners with zero programming experience

Anyone curious about Python and how it works

Those ready to start their programming journey

📢 Join us for an exciting hands-on session where we'll transform from complete beginners to writing our first Python programs!

🚀 Let's code, learn, and grow together!
