| B     | MP2     | **🚀 Mini Project 2: Personal Profile Generator**           | 🛠️ Project   | ✅ **Ready**   |

**Key Learning Focus:**

**Phase A (Sessions 1-4 + MP1):**

- Python installation & VS Code setup with PVM execution understanding
- Variables, data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`), and dynamic typing
- Arithmetic, comparison, and assignment operators with precedence
- **Python indentation rules** and conditional statements (`if/elif/else`)
- Introduction to modules and the `random` module
- **Mini Project 1: Simple Calculator** - Applying Sessions 1-4 concepts

**Phase B (Sessions 5-8 + MP2):**

- Loops (`for`, `while`) with `range()`, `break`, `continue` controls
- **Error reading skills** and built-in functions (`len()`, `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`, `type()`)
- Lists fundamentals with iteration and basic operations
- Dictionaries (key-value pairs) with **basic testing using `assert`**
- **Mini Project 2: Personal Profile Generator** - Applying Sessions 5-8 concepts

**Mini Projects:**

- **Simple Calculator** - Command-line calculator with input validation and continuous operation
- **Personal Profile Generator** - Interactive profile system using dictionaries and lists with data validation

**Learning Outcome:** "I can write basic Python programs with proper structure, understand error messages, and I'm genuinely curious to learn more!"

**Exit Criteria:**

Before moving to Level 2, you should be able to:

- ✅ Write a Python script that uses variables, conditionals, and loops without syntax errors
- ✅ Read and understand basic error messages (NameError, TypeError, IndentationError)
- ✅ Use lists and dictionaries to store and retrieve data
- ✅ Explain why Python uses indentation instead of braces

**Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**

- ❌ **Copy-Paste Without Understanding** – Typing code without knowing what each line does
- ❌ **Ignoring Error Messages** – Not reading the full error traceback to find the problem
- ❌ **Magic Numbers Everywhere** – Using `42` or `"admin"` directly instead of variables
- ❌ **No Comments** – Writing code that only you can understand (even you won't remember in a week)
